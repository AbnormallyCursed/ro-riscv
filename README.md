ROBLOX RISC-V Emulation

The actual CPU is solely by me, and everything is a work in progress, this github page may not be updated to contain the latest source code version.
If you want to see a completed RISC-V emulator (albeit an inefficient and barely-functioning one) it's here: https://github.com/AbnormallyCursed/Archived-Projects-Lua/tree/main/Emulation/RISCV
